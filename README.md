Trait prediction for new breeds is a tedious process. It consumes many resources and time to cultivate a crop and analyze the traits manually. To reduce this cumbersome process, we will provide specific genomic data sequences. This application will predict phenotypic traits of the crop, namely grain weight per spike (GWPS), plant height (PH), grain yield (GY), days to heading (DH), grain filling duration (GFD), and grain number per spike (GNPS). This application will streamline the harvesting and experimentation of every new breed.!
